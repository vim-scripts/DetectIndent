This script provides a command which will attempt to guess the correct indent settings for an open file, for use when there is no modeline available. Note that this is a pure vim implementation, and doesn't require any external applications or interpreters.

Usage:

:DetectIndent

May also be used in an autocommand, for example:

:autocmd BufReadPost * :DetectIndent

Options:

To prefer 'expandtab' to 'noexpandtab' when no detection is possible: 
:let g:detectindent_preferred_expandtab = 1

To specify a preferred indent level when no detection is possible:
:let g:detectindent_preferred_indent = 4

Notes:

Detection is by no means perfect. It won't work if files use especially perverse combinations of spaces and tabs, or weird tab widths. Bug reports and patches encouraged...
